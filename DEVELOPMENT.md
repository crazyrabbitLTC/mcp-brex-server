# Task: Remove ALL Summary Logic from getBudgetPrograms.ts

## Objective
Completely remove ALL summary logic from src/tools/getBudgetPrograms.ts, including response limiting, field projection, and token estimation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All imports of responseLimiter utilities removed
- [ ] summary_only parameter removed from interface
- [ ] fields parameter removed from interface  
- [ ] All estimateTokens usage removed
- [ ] All "tooBig", "summarized" variables removed
- [ ] All field projection logic removed (DEFAULT_FIELDS, project function calls, array mapping)
- [ ] All token size estimation logic removed
- [ ] Tool returns complete budget program objects
- [ ] Proper pagination with limit and cursor parameters retained
- [ ] Tool registration in index.ts updated to remove summary_only from schema
- [ ] Tests verify complete objects are returned without any summarization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis
- [x] Examine current getBudgetPrograms.ts implementation
- [x] Identify all summary-related code to remove
- [x] Check tool registration in index.ts
- [x] Review existing tests

### Phase 2: Write Tests First (TDD)
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite for getBudgetPrograms
- [x] Test that complete budget program objects are returned
- [x] Test pagination with limit and cursor
- [x] Test filtering parameters (budget_program_status)
- [x] Ensure tests fail initially

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [x] Remove responseLimiter imports
- [x] Remove summary_only and fields from interface
- [x] Remove all token estimation logic
- [x] Remove all field projection logic
- [x] Simplify to return complete objects
- [x] Update tool registration in index.ts

### Phase 4: Verification
- [ ] Run all tests
- [ ] Manual testing of the tool
- [ ] Code review
- [ ] Final verification

## Progress Log
- Started: 2025-08-27
- Working in worktree: /Users/dennisonbertram/Develop/ModelContextProtocol/.worktrees-mcp-brex/remove-budget-programs-summary-logic

## Notes
- This tool has complex array projection summary logic that must be completely eliminated
- The tool should return complete budget program objects with no field filtering
- Pagination and status filtering should remain functional

## Edge Cases
- Large result sets should still be handled via pagination (limit/cursor), not summarization
- Empty result sets should return empty array
- Invalid parameters should throw appropriate errors
