# Task: Remove ALL Summary Logic from getCashAccountStatements Tool

## Task Description
Completely remove ALL summary logic from src/tools/getCashAccountStatements.ts. This tool currently has complex summary logic that must be eliminated entirely. The tool should return complete cash account statement objects without any summarization, token limiting, or field projection.

## Success Criteria
- [x] All responseLimiter imports removed (estimateTokens, etc.)
- [x] summary_only parameter completely removed from interface
- [x] fields parameter removed - tool returns complete objects
- [x] All estimateTokens usage removed
- [x] All "tooBig", "summarized" variables and logic removed
- [x] All field projection logic removed (DEFAULT_FIELDS, project function calls)
- [x] All token size estimation logic removed
- [x] Proper pagination parameters maintained
- [x] Tool registration in index.ts updated to remove summary_only from schema
- [x] Tool returns complete statement objects as JSON
- [x] Comprehensive tests written and passing

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research and Analysis
- [x] Examine current getCashAccountStatements.ts implementation
- [x] Identify all summary-related code to be removed
- [x] Check tool registration in index.ts
- [x] Understand the Brex API structure for cash account statements

### Phase 2: TDD - Write Tests First
- [x] Create comprehensive test file for getCashAccountStatements
- [x] Write tests that verify complete objects are returned
- [x] Write tests for pagination parameters
- [x] Write tests for filtering parameters
- [x] Ensure tests fail initially

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [x] Remove all responseLimiter imports
- [x] Remove summary_only parameter from interface
- [x] Remove fields parameter from interface
- [x] Remove all token estimation logic
- [x] Remove all field projection logic
- [x] Simplify tool to just call API and return results
- [x] Update tool registration in index.ts

### Phase 4: Verification
- [x] Run all tests - ensure they pass
- [x] Build passes
- [x] Linting passes
- [ ] Get code review
- [ ] Address review feedback

## Progress Log
- Created worktree: feature/remove-summary-logic-cash-statements
- Analyzed existing implementation - found summary logic with fields projection and token limiting
- Created comprehensive test file with 13 test cases covering all requirements
- Tests initially failed as expected (TDD)
- Removed ALL summary logic from getCashAccountStatements.ts
- Updated tool registration in index.ts to remove summary_only and fields parameters
- All 13 tests now pass
- TypeScript build successful
- Linting passes with no errors or warnings
